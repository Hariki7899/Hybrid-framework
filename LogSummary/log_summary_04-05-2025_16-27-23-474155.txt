Okay, I will analyze the logs you provided.

**Analysis of Logs from 05/04/2025 01:51:01 PM to 05/04/2025 01:53:11 PM**

I'm focusing on the latest batch of logs, specifically those from **05/04/2025 01:51:01 PM to 05/04/2025 01:53:11 PM**.

**General Trend and Deviations:**

*   The general trend appears to be the execution of tests `Test005Login`, `Test001Login`, `Test002DDTLogin`, `Test004Logout`, and `Test003Registeruser`.
*   The logs indicate successful execution for the majority of test steps.

**Key Observations and Concerns:**

*   **Redundant Test Execution:** There's a lot of redundant execution as 5 instances of same test **Test005Login,Test001Login,Test002DDTLogin,Test004Logout,Test003Registeruser** is running at same time.**This could indicate an issue with the test execution framework or configuration, leading to unnecessary resource consumption and potentially masking genuine issues.**
*   **Time Consumption in Test005Login :** Time consumption is more in Test005Login i.e. "verifying contact form" test case.  There can be a slow network and server issues which is casuing this issue. Need to optimise network call for that.
*    **All the test are executed successfully.**
**Suggestions**
-   Check and optimise "Setting values for Contact form" so that the network issues which is increasing the duration of execution for **Test005Login**.
-   Optimise your test execution framework to remove duplication. 

Let me know if you have more logs to analyse!
